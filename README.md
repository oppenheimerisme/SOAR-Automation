# SOAR-Automation

## Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) tools are used to streamline and automate security operations. Common day-to-day SOAR automation tasks include:

## 1. Incident Enrichment and Triage:

* IP Address/Domain Reputation Check: Automatically check an IP or domain against threat intelligence feeds to assess its reputation.
* User Activity Review: Collect user activity from logs to identify suspicious behavior during an incident.
* File Hash Lookups: Automatically search for malicious file hashes in databases like VirusTotal.
* GeoIP Lookup: Automate the process of identifying the geographic location of suspicious IP addresses.

## 2. Automated Response Actions:

* Blocking IPs or Domains: Automatically add suspicious IPs to firewalls, IDS/IPS, or other security devices based on predefined rules.
* Disabling User Accounts: Temporarily disable a compromised user account in Active Directory or other authentication systems.
* Quarantining Devices: Automatically isolate compromised devices by applying network access control (NAC) rules.


## 3. Phishing Investigation and Response:

* Email Header Analysis: Automate the extraction and analysis of email headers for phishing attempts.
* Attachment and Link Scanning: Automatically scan email attachments or links for malware or phishing indicators.
* End-User Notification: Automatically send alerts to users when phishing emails are detected and quarantined.


## 4. Vulnerability Management:

* Patch Verification: Automatically verify whether a vulnerability has been patched by checking system configurations.
* Automated Scanning: Schedule vulnerability scans and automatically review results for critical issues.
* Remediation Ticket Creation: Automate the process of creating tickets for unpatched systems.


## 5. SIEM Alert Handling:

* Correlating Alerts: Automate the correlation of related alerts from a SIEM system and prioritize incidents.
* False Positive Handling: Automatically filter out false positives or notify analysts to review recurring false alerts.


## 6. Threat Intelligence Management:

* Automating Threat Feed Ingestion: Automatically pull in threat intelligence feeds from multiple sources to keep security rules updated.
* IOC (Indicators of Compromise) Monitoring: Monitor network traffic, endpoints, and logs for the presence of known IOCs and take action when detected.


## 7. Compliance and Reporting:

* Automated Compliance Checks: Regularly verify that systems meet regulatory compliance requirements (e.g., PCI DSS, GDPR).
* Incident Reporting: Automatically generate and send incident reports after an investigation or response has been completed.


## 8. Playbook Execution:

* Running Incident Playbooks: Trigger predefined incident response playbooks that guide investigations and automate routine steps, such as gathering logs, escalating to analysts, or notifying stakeholders.


## 9. Log Collection and Analysis:

* Centralized Log Aggregation: Automate the collection of logs from various systems like firewalls, IDS, endpoints, and cloud infrastructure for analysis.
* Log Parsing and Correlation: Automatically parse logs to identify patterns or suspicious activities (e.g., multiple failed login attempts).


## 10. Automated Threat Containment:

* Endpoint Isolation: Automatically isolate compromised endpoints from the network until further investigation.
* Suspicious Process Termination: Automate the termination of suspicious processes running on compromised endpoints.
* These tasks help security teams reduce manual intervention, improve incident response times, and maintain consistent security postures across their environment.
